 	ethercat-software-framework-public/ESF/Source/SSC

 3. For quick verification, "sample_app.xls" added. Sample application xls file can be used
  at the time of SSC code generation.

	ethercat-software-framework-public/ESF/Demo/ESF_EVB_LAN9253

 4. The SSC folder already has three files named "sample_app.c, sample_app.h and sample_appObjects.h"
  And are given for reference to make it work with the sample application. 

 4. Current Demo apllication related functions are added in sample_app.c and sample_app.h
  
 5. The Generated SSC code also contain sample_app.c, sample_app.h and sample_appObjects.h. 
  For quick verification, the above mentioned three files can be used as it is.
